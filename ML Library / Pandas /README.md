## ðŸ“š  Data Preprocesing in Machine Learning using Pandas

ðŸ”— Data preprocessing is required tasks for cleaning the data and making it suitable for a machine learning model which also increases the accuracy and efficiency of a machine learning model.

ðŸŽ¯ Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. 
Preprocessing is the process of doing a pre-analysis of data, in order to transform them into a standard and normalized format.

ðŸ’¡ Preprocessing involves the following aspects:

- missing values
- data standardization
- data normalization
- data binning
